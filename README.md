# P5_Vehicle_Detection_and_Tracking
Detect, locate and track Vehicles on a lane using image classification techniques

---

This project has two main solution files namely `P5_solution_pipeline.ipynb` and `video_car_tracker.py`. The former is used to visualize and experiment with data and eventually train a linear SVM classifier. The latter is used to analyse and modify the project video based on the classification of the trained classifier. For more information on the techniques used, the entire solution pipeline and its explanations, please see [here](./writeup.md).
